# 30 days of Consistency from (Devsnest)[]

From devsnest server announcement :

Launching Consistency challenge for February to see how consistently we can do something.ðŸš€

Starting with February Consistency Challenge


Most people know the drill but I would give you the gist
ðŸš€  Comment your Feb goals (should be quantified) in ðŸš€february-consistency-challenge . Deadline 6th Feb midnight.
ðŸš€  Everyday put up a message in the channel stating your progress. Any Day you forget to put this message before 12 midnight youre out of the challenge.

Consistency matters more than progress. so even without progress if you manage to post everyday youre still in the game.

Tomorrow would be Day 1 for your challenge. Put up your goals and then put up your day 1 progress by end of day tomorrow(6th feb).

Keep you goals ambitious @everyone . Commit to them. Then do whatever it takes to fulfill them.
