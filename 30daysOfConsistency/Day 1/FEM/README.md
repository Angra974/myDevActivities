## My process

I've created the desing on Figma with the help of the images files to :
  1. Train to use figma;
  2. Determine the size and position of elements

Decided to code all in only the index.html file with inline Css and Js as the project is simple.

For the accordeon, the choice was to use details/Summary as a way to open/close the details.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to use details with summary, as usually i didn't use them but seems to be pretty cool.
Learn how the open attribute for details works and how to close them when one is clicked.
